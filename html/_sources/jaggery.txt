What is Jaggery.js?
===================


Serverside scripting
--------------------
Server-side scripting is used in website design to embed scripts in HTML code so that user’s request to the server can be handled by the script running server-side before the server responds to the client’s request. It is used to provide an interface and to limit client access to databases and other sources. Setting up a Web application today can be a nightmare since all of the different components (UI, back-end, server-side logic etc) are written using different languages. In every step there is a mismatched conversion which leads to a potential loss of information. These platforms are an attempted solution to these problems.


Jaggery.js
----------
JaggeryJS offers a completely Javascript way to write all parts of Web applications and services as a way to reduce/eliminate impedance mismatches across different layers of the Web application and API development experience.It is a  framework to write webapps and HTTP-focused web services in pure Javascript for all aspects of the application: front-end, communication, Server-side logic and persistence.It closes the gap between Web apps from Web services by allowing one to create both applications and APIs at the same time.
